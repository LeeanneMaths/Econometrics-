# 📊 NZ-CHN Data Analysis Portfolio

This repository showcases my data analysis, econometrics, and macroeconomic modeling work completed during postgraduate study and subsequent independent research.  
It serves as a technical portfolio to demonstrate proficiency in **data analysis, econometric modeling, and research coding**, supporting future applications for **Data Analyst, Research Assistant, and Quantitative Intern** positions.

---

## 🧠 Overview

The repository combines coursework, experimental scripts, and research-oriented analysis focused on:
- Applied **time series and panel data analysis**
- **Macroeconomics and productivity** modeling
- **Education and gender** research (NZ–CHN comparison)
- Exploratory work using **Python**, **Stata**, and **MATLAB**

Many scripts originated from academic exercises but have been extended and reorganized as independent code examples to demonstrate analytical thinking and coding competence.
